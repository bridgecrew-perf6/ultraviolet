# Welcome to the NYU UltraViolet Docs Wiki

UltraViolet ðŸ’œ is a service of the New York University Libraries and New York University IT. UltraViolet provides long-term access to a broad range of NYU-related digital content, including open access data associated with research and scholarly output and data licensed for use by members of the NYU community. UltraViolet is an NYU-specific implementation of the InvenioRDM framework.

Here you'll find guides for participating in our Dev and Metadata sprints. The project-wide service planning documents live, albeit in a messy form, in the [NYU SB3 Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q40bQ5bVZYn5_QhxbPDhhIAYZk3R7434?usp=sharing)  
## Overview

The UltraViolet codebase lives in the [nyudlts /
ultraviolet](https://github.com/nyudlts/ultraviolet) GitHub repo.  
This site is built by GitHub pages using the files in the `docs` directory of the main UltraViolet repo.


## Contributing

To contribute to this documentation wiki, you can:
 1. Use GitHub's Markdown editing interface to create a new branch with your single-page edit, or
 2. Clone the repo, make your changes and preview them locally with Jekyll, and push them as a new branch. (More info available [here]().)

Either way, make sure to commit your local branch with changes and submit a PR to the `main` branch when you're ready.
